# Build a QA Bot Web App

A QA bot is an automated system designed to answer questions posed by users. These bots can handle a wide range of queries, providing accurate and contextually relevant responses. When integrated with LangChain and an LLM, a QA bot can analyze large documents and deliver precise answers based on the content within those documents.

It simulates a real-world scenario where you are required to build a bot that will leverage LangChain and a large language model (LLM) to answer questions based on content from loaded PDF documents.

The project involves several key components and techniques including:â€¯

Document loading using document loaders

Splitting long documents using text splitters

Generating embeddings using embedding models

Storing embeddings using vector databases

Defining retrievers

Setting up Gradio as the front-end interface

Using these elements, you will build a fully functional question-answering (QA) system. By leveraging LangChain and an LLM, the bot will be able to read and understand the content of loaded PDF documents and provide accurate and relevant answers to user queries.
